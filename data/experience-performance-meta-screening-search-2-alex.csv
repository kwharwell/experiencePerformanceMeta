The knot quality was assessed using a quantifiable fivepoint scale as previously described by Muresan et al.",635,The first group (n = 5) consisted of senior physicians with previous experience of N100 laparoscopic interventions and N20 laparoscopic sutures. The second group (n = 5) was made up of surgical residents in the first four years of residency training. These participants had previously performed N10 laparoscopic interventions and b20 laparoscopic sutures. The third group (n = 10) contained medical students between their third and sixth year of study without any prior experience in laparoscopic surgery,634

Imam,2017,The building performance gap: Are modellers literate?,Further Review,,yes,,"s. A total of 108 building modellers were asked to comment on the importance of obtaining and using accurate values for 21 common modelling input variables, from U-values to occupancy schedules when using dynamic simulation to estimate annual energy demand. The questioning was based on a real building for which high-resolution energy, occupancy and temperature data were recorded. A sensitivity analysis was then conducted using a model of the building (based on the measured data) by perturbing one parameter in each simulation",351,"Figure 9 shows the nature of the participants, in terms of years of experience within the construction industry. The highest academic degree achieved related to this field was reported as: bachelors (34 participants), masters (66), PhD (8). Eighty per cent of respondents selected IES VE as the simulation software they used for energy analysis.",360-361
